## Tourism Management System Based on Springboot

This tourism management system based on Springboot is mainly developed in Java language, utilizing many advantages of the Springboot framework, such as automatic configuration, built-in servers, rich plugins, and out-of-the-box functionality. 
At the same time, the system also combines the front-end framework Vue.js, persistence layer framework MyBatis Plus and other technologies to achieve efficient, flexible, and easy-to-maintain tourism management functions.
